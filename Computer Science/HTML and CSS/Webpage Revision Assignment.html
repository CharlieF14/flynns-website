        <p>Posted by: Damian Wielgosik</p>
        <p>Justin Beaver confessed something something that even his greatest fans would have never expected of the skilled musicians and lyricist. The young rock-and-roller admitted that<br/>
        since he typed his first title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those surrounding the Canadian that Beaver's private mentors, Ryan Loseling and<br/>
        Nicolas Crate, often walk around Los Angeles disputing what a greeat tool the HTML validator is.</p>

        <p>Beaver has already created some websites and does not intend to stop there. "I will probably have a song about HTML on my next album," - the artist added.</p>
