                To meet 'Basic Requirement 1' the model used both analog and digital inputs, which took form as button presses, whether the system was on or off, the user's heart rate, and short chimes. These inputs and outputs allowed for the front-end user to know when the system has begun and when it has ended, and allows the system to run calculations for the users data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking into the data I gained through my form that was answered by potential users, I realized that many users would find it more enjoyable and easier to exercise if they were to be able to view their workout statistics such as heart rate. Due to this I chose to implement the average workout bpm of the user's heart. This user feedback also linked into 'Advanced Requirement 3', where the heart rate history in the last workout would be displayed in a graphical format to both meet the requirement and visually show information about the user's heart health.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data was stored in firebase to meet 'Basic Requirement 2' and in order to complete the rest of the requirements. This data was then accessed and used to meet 'Advanced Requirements 1 and 2' to create two what-if questions that could be calculated by the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further this model, I would personally begin to make the data more consistent by validating the data to a much further degree. I would also gather more data from potential end users to mold my ideas going into the future. More calculations could also then be ran by the system to give a wider array of data for the user to view.
