                    <p>Starting off my investigation, I looked at many different systems that fit the project brief. While there are an infinite number of systems that can be linked into wellbeing, I wished to design a system that drew inspiration from fitness, sports and rest.</p>
                    <p>The first system I looked into was the sleep tracking capabilities of a smart watch such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch. Believing that sleep is incredibly important to wellbeing, I looked into the capabilities of these watches. However, after gathering the information I decided that a sleep tracker would require much more advanced components.</p>
                    <p>The second system I looked at were dedicated heart rate sensors such as the Polar H10 heart rate monitor. These monitors can acquire an abundance of information from the wearer, giving them insights into their heartâ€™s health and various other valuable tips. This system, while being extremely close to my desired system, felt too specific and would not give information into some areas that I wished to explore.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I examined the system of Recovery Time and Heart Rate built into devices such as multiple Garmin devices. These systems encompassed exactly the type of wellbeing I was trying to improve, so I decided to base my embedded system off these. Since I am interested in sport, I felt that this system would suit my interests and eventually would help me keep interest into my project.</p>
                    <p>My system functions by having a pulse sensor reading the users heart rate for the duration of their workout, such as a run. The system will be activated at the start of the user's workout to track time and from that give the user insight into their hearts health. The target audience that I aim to provide to would be athletes or regular people aiming to gain fitness. In order to get user insights, I created a form and sent it out to fellow students.</p>
                    <p>My system gathers information on various factors such as length of workout and heart rate, while using these values to estimate rest times.</p>
                    <p>
                        My objectives for this project are to model an embedded system that can:
                    </p>    
                    <p> - Utilises a heart rate sensor to provide an analogue input and a button press starting the workout as a digital input. The average resting time will be outputted in a graphical format and the digital output of whether the system has been activated will also be presented in a graphical format, showing how many times it was used.</p>
                    <p> - The data that will be gathered shall be stored in firebase to gain easy access to it.</p>
                    <p> - The heart rate and resting times will be gathered in order to inform decisions on workout habits for various people with different goals.</p>
